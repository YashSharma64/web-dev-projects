## üè∑Ô∏è Adding New Projects

### Steps to Add a New Project

1. **Ensure Compatibility:**
   - Your project should utilize **HTML**, **CSS**, or **JavaScript**.

2. **Create a New Directory:**
   - Name the directory descriptively (e.g., `responsive-navbar`, `color-changer`).
   - Add all necessary project files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, etc.) inside this new directory.

3. **Add a `README.md` File:**
   - Ensure your project includes a `README.md` file that provides:
     - A brief description of the project and its purpose.
     - Instructions on how to set up and run the project.
     - Screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the project (optional but recommended).
     - A **Live Demo** section with a link to view the project:
       ```markdown
       ## Live Demo
       [Click here to view the live demo](https://dsch-web-dev-projects.vercel.app/Your-Project-Directory/index.html)
       ```

4. **Update `projects.json` File:**
   - Add your project information to the `projects.json` file in the following format:
     ```json
     {
       "thumbnail": "/thumbnails/your-project-thumbnail.png",
       "title": "Your Project Title",
       "link": "/your-project-directory/index.html",
       "readme": "/your-project-directory/README.md"
     }
     ```
   - Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual project data.

5. **Upload Your Project Thumbnail:**
   - Add a thumbnail image (e.g., `your-project-thumbnail.png`) to the `thumbnails` folder.
   - Name the file descriptively, matching your project name or title.

6. **Check for Consistency:**
   - Ensure all links and file paths are correct, and that your project integrates smoothly with the existing structure.

7. **Test Your Project:**
   - Verify that your project runs as expected and matches the description provided in the `README.md`.

By following these steps, you'll ensure a smooth addition of your project to the repository, maintaining consistency and ease of use for everyone.
